	\section*{About Me}\hrule
	I am a \textbf{detail-oriented} and \textbf{flexible learner} with extensive experience in various fields such as \textbf{Web Development}, Deep Learning, Networking, \textbf{Linux}, \textbf{Windows}, and more. As a \textbf{team player}, I enjoy working alongside others to achieve common goals. I am always seeking new experiences and challenges, preferring to take on new and exciting projects rather than routine work. My reputation for \textbf{creativity}, \textbf{problem-solving}, \textbf{hard work}, and teamwork is a testament to my character. I have mastered \textbf{Symfony framework} and \textbf{Node.js}, which has given me the ability to develop and improve complex projects. For instance, in my previous job, I worked on \textbf{Microservice architecture} and introduced modern and automated solutions using \textbf{Docker}, \textbf{Ansible}, and \textbf{Gitlab CI/CD} to increase productivity and efficiency. My passion for learning led me to expand my skill set by mastering \textbf{Angular}, which elevated my position in Bugloss Company from a backend developer to a full-stack developer. During my time at Heyzha Company, I designed and developed complicated portals using \textbf{Laravel} and \textbf{Yii2} frameworks.
